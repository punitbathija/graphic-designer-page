- This assignment was quite tricky as it had an `background-image` to set for only left container also I had to set an `z-index:-1` for all the rest of the elements which were behind the image.

## Learnings

- I set the `background-image` to left and all the elements with the `z-index:-1` to achieve the transparecy of the background.
- I have used the `text-stroke` property to only use the border for the `h1` element.
